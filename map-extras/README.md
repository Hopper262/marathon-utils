=========================

These files can be used in conjunction with mapxml2images.pl to replicate the level images shown at [lhowon.org](https://www.lhowon.org/).

### M1_ignored_polys.txt, M2_ignored_polys.txt, M3_ignored_polys.txt

These hand-built files suppress polygons which will never end up on a player's automap in the normal course of play. The finished maps thus look closer to a "fully completed" automap without showing unreachable areas.

### ProFontAO.ttf

This font is used for map annotations within Aleph One itself.

### commands.sh

Shows the process and options used at lhowon.org. Will almost certainly fail if you run it as-is.
