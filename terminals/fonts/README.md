==============================

The Courier text files here were generated from Apple's original bitmaps, using the "nfnt2txt.pl", "faux\_bold.pl", and "faux\_italic.pl" scripts from my "classic-mac-utils" repository. This format is supported by termxml2images.pl, and these files are referenced by the "config.ph" example.

The "config-pdf.ph" example references the Courier Prime font, which is available for free at:
